# TODO REST API

Create a REST API to manage user tasks list.

To implement the REST API just fork the repository and open a new pull request for each feature (just on you personal repo please).

# Notes and considerations
* The API needs to be built in Node.js
* Preferable using express framework and mongodb
* Give particular attention in building the API with good design and user experience and good test coverage

# Feature list

1. As a user I should be able to add a new item.
2. As a user I should list my todo items.
3. As a user I should be able to remove a new item.
4. As a user I should be able to modify an existent item.
5. As a user I should be able to set a priority on an item.
6. As a user I should be able to set a due date on an item.
7. As a user I should be able to sort my todo list by due date.
8. As a user I should be able to sort my todo list by priority.
9. As a user I should be able to set an item as completed.
10. As a user I should be able to assign a task to another user using github id.
11. As a user I should be able to list tasks assigned to a github user

**It's more important to build less features and complete then build incomplete ones.**
